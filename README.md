The website’s responsive and elegant design is powered by Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, making it both aesthetic and user-friendly across all devices. Users can easily browse different apps, view app details, and analyze popularity trends through interactive charts and visual data.

This project is a great example of using React for dynamic UI rendering and Tailwind for modern, component-based styling.
